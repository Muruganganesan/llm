Ashish Nehra (pronunciationⓘ; born 29 April 1979) is an Indian cricket coach and former cricketer who played in all formats of the game. Nehra announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in late 2017, with the Twenty20 International match against New Zealand on 1 November 2017 at Feroz Shah Kotla Ground his last appearance. With India, Nehra was a member of the Indian team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, which the title was also shared with Sri Lanka, and was a member of the team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup although he did not play in the final.
Early and personal life[edit]
Nehra was born in Sadar Bazaar, Delhi Cantonment to Diwan Singh Nehra and Sumitra Nehra. Nehra was very passionate about cricket from an early age. Nehra would ride scooters with Virender Sehwag to the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in Delhi to be able to play cricket. This allowed him to grow success and eventually rise through the ranks. He eventually join the Delhi team to participate in the Ranji Trophy.
International career[edit]
He made his debut against Sri Lanka national cricket team. On 26 February 2003, during the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup, Nehra took 6 for 23 against England, which was the best bowling figures by an Indian bowler in Cricket World Cup history until Mohammad Shami surpassed it against New Zealand on 15 November 2023 during the semi-final of the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup.
Nehra was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2016 T20 World Cup by the ICC and ESPNcricinfo.
In the 2013–14 Ranji Trophy, he took 6/16 from 10 overs to bowl out Vidarbha for a meagre 88 in the first innings at the Roshanara Club Ground at Delhi.
After recovering from the ankle injury that prevented him from playing for the Delhi Ranji Team in the 2007–08 season, Nehra joined the Indian Premier League and signed up for the Mumbai Indians franchise. For his performances in 2014 and 2015 for Chennai Super Kings, he was named in the ESPNcricinfo CLT20 XI.
Coaching career[edit]
In January 2018, Royal Challengers Bangalore appointed Nehra as their bowling coach. He retained his position for the 2019 IPL.
In January 2022, he was appointed the head coach of newly formed Indian Premier League franchise Gujarat Titans. In the 2022 IPL season, Gujarat Titans finished top of the table and went on to win the trophy in the final against Rajasthan Royals.
