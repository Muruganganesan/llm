Early life[edit]

Domestic career[edit]
In 2012, Jadhav made his first triple century, scoring 327, the second-highest by a Maharashtra batsman in the Ranji Trophy, against Uttar Pradesh at Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. During the 2013–14 Ranji Trophy season, he scored 1,223 runs, including six centuries, the fourth-highest runs aggregate in the tournament's history. This helped Maharashtra make their first Ranji Trophy final since 1992/93. Jadhav also represented India A and West Zone cricket team.

In the third match of the same series, he scored 90 runs and almost guided India home in a pursuit of 320.
