Shikhar Dhawan (born 5 December 1985) is an Indian former cricketer who played as an opening batter. He was a regular member of the Indian team in limited-overs formats for over a decade and represented Delhi in domestic cricket. He was named the Player of the Tournament in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and was leading run-scorer at the 2015 World Cup. Across ICC World Cups and Champions Trophies, he averaged 65.15, the highest among players with over 1000 runs.
Dhawan made his One Day International (ODI) debut against Australia in October 2010 at Visakhapatnam. His Test debut came against the same opposition in March 2013 at Mohali, where he scored the fastest century by any batsman on Test debut (85 balls) and ended his innings with 187 runs from 174 balls. This is also the highest score by an Indian on a Test debut.
In August 2013, Dhawan scored 248 off 150 balls for India A against South Africa A in a List A match, which was then the second-highest individual score in the format. He later became the first Indian to score a century in his 100th ODI, during a match against South Africa in Johannesburg. On 14 June 2018, he scored a century before lunch on the opening day of a Test against Afghanistan. Dhawan also went through phases of inconsistent form, both in domestic and international cricket. On 24 August 2024, Dhawan announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.
Early life[edit]
Dhawan was born on 5 December 1985 in Delhi, India to Sunaina and Mahendra Pal Dhawan into a Punjabi family. He completed his schooling at St. Mark's Senior Secondary Public School in Meera Bagh, Delhi. Since the age of 12, he trained at Sonnet Club under the guidance of coach Tarak Sinha, who has trained 12 international cricketers. Dhawan was a wicket-keeper when he first joined the club. Despite being a right hander who writes right handed, Dhawan learnt to bat left handed.
Early career[edit]
Youth career[edit]
Dhawan first played for Delhi Under-16s in the 1999/00 Vijay Merchant Trophy and was the leading run-scorer of the 2000/01 Vijay Merchant Trophy in which Delhi finished runners-up. He scored 755 runs from 9 innings at an average of 83.88 with two centuries and a top score of 199. Dhawan was selected in the North Zone Under-16s squad for the Vijay Hazare Trophy in February 2001. He scored 30 and 66 in the semifinal against South Zone.
Dhawan's impressive performances for Delhi Under-16s were rewarded when he was picked in the India Under-17 squad for the 2000/01 ACC Under-17 Asia Cup. He played three games in the tournament averaging 85. Dhawan was subsequently drafted into the Delhi Under-19 team in October 2001, at the age of 15, for the Cooch Behar Trophy. In 2001/02 Vijay Merchant Trophy, Dhawan impressed once again with the bat by scoring 282 runs in 5 innings at an average of 70.50.
In October 2002, Dhawan was selected again in the Delhi Under-19 team for the Cooch Behar Trophy in which he made 388 runs from 8 innings at an average of 55.42 including two centuries. He was then picked to play for North Zone Under-19s in January 2003 in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. Dhawan scored 45 and 12 in the semifinal against Central Zone, before top-scoring for his team with 71 in the final on a seaming track in Rohtak against East Zone securing his team an innings-win. In the CK Nayudu Trophy held in February 2003, Dhawan averaged 55.50 with the bat for North Zone Under-19s. He continued to amass runs at the Under-19 domestic level as he scored 444 runs from 6 innings at an average of 74 in the Cooch Behar Trophy in October after which he was made the captain of the Delhi Under-19 team. Dhawan averaged 66.66 in the MA Chidambaram Trophy held in December that year which was his first tournament as captain.

Dhawan's runs came at an average of 84.16, with three centuries and a fifty, and was named Player of the Tournament. In the two youth Tests against England the following January, he had scores of 69, 18, and 41.
Early domestic career[edit]
Dhawan made his first-class debut for Delhi against Andhra in November 2004, in the 2004–05 season of the Ranji Trophy scoring 49 on his debut innings. He finished as Delhi's leading run-getter that Ranji season with a total of 461 runs from 6 matches and a high score of 130, scoring more runs than experienced players in the team like Ajay Jadeja and Aakash Chopra. In the Ranji One-day Trophy that followed, Dhawan made his List A debut against Jammu & Kashmir in January 2005. He then scored back-to-back unbeaten hundreds against Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. He was picked in the India Seniors squad for the Challenger Trophy in February, in which he opened the innings against India B with future India teammate MS Dhoni. In the second match, Dhawan scored a 124-ball 126, sharing a 246-run first-wicket partnership with Dhoni who also struck a century, helping India Seniors chase down 276 for the loss of two wickets. He was selected in the India A team to play in the one-off 50-over match against the touring Pakistani team in March that year. He scored 8 before being bowled by Naved-ul-Hasan.
In 2005/06 Challenger Trophy in October 2005, Dhawan played for India B and had a disappointing series with the bat. He had scores of 30, 40, and 26, unable to convert the starts into big knocks. He scored 117 for North Zone against Zimbabwe Cricket Union President's XI in the Duleep Trophy and 65 for Board President's XI in a three-day match against the touring Sri Lankan team. He averaged 34.40 in the 2005–06 Ranji season, but returned to form in the Ranji One-day Trophy scoring at an average of 40.75 from five games. Dhawan was drafted into the North Zone squad for Deodhar Trophy later that month where he continued to be in good form with scores of 56 against Central Zone, 65 against West Zone, 44 against South Zone and 5 against East Zone. North Zone went on to win the tournament and retain the trophy. Dhawan represented India A in the EurAsia Cricket Series in April–May 2006, a limited-overs tournament held at Abu Dhabi between India A, Ireland A, Netherlands A, Pakistan A and United Arab Emirates. He finished as the leading run-scorer of the tournament with 288 runs from 5 matches at an average of 72 including a hundred and two fifties.
Dhawan started the 2006-07 Ranji season with a century against Tamil Nadu, batting at number three. He was made captain of the Delhi team for the Ranji One-day Trophy in February 2007, despite the presence of international players in the lineup such as Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Aakash Chopra and Ashish Nehra. Dhawan scored 161 runs in the tournament at an average of 32.20 with a top score of 46 while Delhi could not progress past the quarterfinals. He batted at four for North Zone in the Deodhar Trophy in February–March and averaged 23.66 from three innings.
Delhi won the 2007–08 season of Ranji Trophy in which Dhawan made 570 runs from 8 matches at an average of 43.84 including two hundreds. In the Duleep Trophy that followed, he averaged 42.25 in his three games for North Zone. He was the second-highest run-getter in the Vijay Hazare Trophy (earlier called Ranji One-day Trophy) in February–March 2008, accumulating 389 runs in 6 matches at an average of 97.25 with two hundreds and a strike rate of over 100. However, Dhawan lost his form during the Deodhar Trophy in March when he played for North Zone and made scores of 0, 1 and 5. He failed to make an impression playing for India A in a four-day match against New Zealand A in September as he scored 27 and 7.
Dhawan returned to form in the 2008–09 Ranji season with 415 runs at an average over 69, but had an indifferent run in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in February 2009 with an average of 18.80 in six innings.
Dhawan played for India Red in the Challenger Trophy in October 2009. He averaged 48.33 in that tournament which India Red won. His good form continued in the Ranji Trophy as he scored 224 in the season's opening match against Baroda and 100 in the second game against Karnataka. However, Dhawan suffered an injury in the third match which kept him on the sidelines for four weeks He returned to the team during the knockout stage and finished the Ranji season with a total of 451 runs from 6 innings averaging 75.16. In February 2010, Dhawan played five matches for Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and scored the most runs for his team, 327 runs at 81.75, including a century (155*) and two fifties, earning himself a spot in the North Zone team for Deodhar Trophy in March. He made an unbeaten 85 in the semifinal against East Zone and 48 in the final against West Zone, helping North Zone lift the trophy.
Inconsistent seasons[edit]
Dhawan was recalled in India A squad that toured England in June–July 2010. In the first game of the tour, a three-day match against Yorkshire, Dhawan scored 179 off 208 balls to help India A post 473/3d. Yorkshire was bowled out for 219 in their first innings and the match ended in a draw. In the limited-overs triangular series involving England Lions, India A, and West Indies A, Dhawan scored 166 runs from 4 innings at an average of 41.50 and a strike rate of 130.70.
Dhawan was selected in the Rest of India squad to play against the defending Ranji champions Mumbai in the Irani Cup in October 2010. He scored 83 in the first innings as the Rest of India won by 361 runs. He was then selected to play for India Blue in the Challengers Trophy. Dhawan was dismissed run out for a duck in the first game against India Red before he scored a 121-ball 109 in the second match against India Green. India Red beat India Green in the final at Indore where he scored 44. This string of strong performances earned him his maiden international call-up against Australia in October.
In November 2010, Dhawan returned to playing for Delhi in 2010–11 Ranji Trophy. He scored a total of 486 runs in 7 matches at an average of 44.18. He registered only one hundred in that season, a 149 against Gujarat at Delhi after Gujarat were bowled out for 71 in their first innings. After failing to make it to the Indian squad for the South African tour in December, he struggled with form in Duleep Trophy, Vijay Hazare Trophy and Deodhar Trophy.
After his poor performances in the West Indies, Dhawan was unable to find a place in the Indian squad that toured England later that year and resumed his domestic commitments. In October 2011, playing for the Rest of India against Rajasthan in the Irani Cup final at Jaipur, he scored 177 off 165 balls in the first innings and 155 off 126 balls in the second innings. The Rest of India went on to win the match by 404 runs, and Dhawan was awarded the man of the match for his efforts. He was out of form in the 2011–12 Ranji Trophy as he scored 296 runs at an average of 32.88 with no hundreds, while Delhi finished sixth in their seven-team group and could not progress to the knockout stage. Dhawan returned to form in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in February–March 2012, scoring 291 runs in eight matches at an average of 48.50 including three fifties. Delhi managed to reach the semifinal which they lost to Mumbai.
In June 2012, India A toured West Indies to play 3 four-day matches, 3 List A matches and two T20s against West Indies A, and Dhawan was included in India A squad. He struggled with the bat in the entire tour, failing to post a single fifty-plus score. He averaged 7.50 in the first two four-day matches before getting dropped from the team for the third game. In the two T20s, he averaged 27 with a strike rate of less than 100, and scored 49 runs in the two List A matches at an average of 24.50.
2012–13 season[edit]
Dhawan was in sublime form at the start of the 2012–13 season. He played for India A in the Challenger Trophy in September–October 2012. In the first match against Bengal, he scored an unbeaten 99 to help India A chase down the target of 194 for the loss of two wickets and won the man of the match award. He scored a 139-ball 152 in the next match against India B, as India A won by 4 runs. In the final against India B, he scored 61, but India A were bowled out for 217 and fell short of the target by 139 runs. In the Duleep Trophy that followed, he was named the captain of the North Zone squad. He won the man of the match award in the quarterfinal match against West Zone, after scoring 101 and 50. In the semifinal against Central Zone, Dhawan scored 121 and 37.
Dhawan continued his good form in the 2012–13 Ranji Trophy, scoring 461 runs including two centuries at an average of 51.22. He was named the captain of Delhi for the one-off List A match against the touring England team in January 2013. He scored 110 off 109 balls in Delhi's run-chase of 295, helping Delhi win the match by 6 wickets. He was then selected in the Rest of India squad for 2013 Irani Cup match against Mumbai in February 2013. Opening the innings with Murali Vijay, he scored 63 and 0. The match ended in a draw, but Rest of India retained the title on first-innings lead.
International career[edit]
Early years[edit]
In October 2010, the Indian selectors selected a "second string" squad for a three-match ODI series against Australia, in which Dhawan was picked in the 14-man squad which was the first occasion he featured in an Indian senior team squad. India captain Dhoni backed Dhawan before the series saying, "Both of us scored in the Challengers in Mumbai (in 2005). I got a chance to establish myself in the national team. There has been ups and downs in his career but he has been quite consistent. As an opener, it's quite tough, as you have Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, and Gautam Gambhir all at the same level. It's good that he got a chance finally. Hope he scores and the bench will become stronger". Dhawan made his international debut, along with Saurabh Tiwary, in the second ODI at Visakhapatnam on 20 October. Australia, who batted first, made 289/3 in 50 overs, and Dhawan opened the innings for India in the run-chase. He did not score off the first delivery and was bowled off the second by Clint McKay.
In June 2011, India toured the West Indies for three Tests, five ODIs, and one T20I. India's regular openers in limited-overs, Sehwag and Gambhir were ruled out of the tour due to shoulder injuries, whereas Tendulkar decided to rest himself after the World Cup win and the IPL. The selectors picked Dhawan in the limited-overs squad in spite of his poor performance in the previous domestic season as he showed signs of returning to form during the IPL. He made his T20I debut against West Indies on 4 June at Port of Spain where he opened the innings with Parthiv Patel and was dismissed after an 11-ball 5. In the first match of the ODI series, playing the second ODI of his career, Dhawan scored 51 off 76 balls. India eventually chased down 215 with 4 wickets in hand. He had scores of 3, 4, and 11 in the other matches he played in the series.
Test debut and Champions Trophy[edit]
After consistent performances in the 2012–13 domestic season, Dhawan was rewarded with a call-up to the Indian Test squad in February 2013 for the four-match series against Australia. He was the third-choice opener in the squad which consisted of Test regulars Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay. India chose Sehwag and Vijay over Dhawan in the first two Tests, after which Sehwag was dropped from the squad owing to his poor form. No replacement was named in the squad for Sehwag, which made Dhawan the favourite to take his place in the third Test. Dhawan made his Test debut in the Test at Mohali on 14 March, receiving the cap from Sachin Tendulkar who said to him: "We have known you as a very gutsy player in domestic cricket, now we hope to see you as a gutsy player in international cricket, so show us some guts." The first day of the match was washed out by rain, and Australia elected to bat first after winning the toss on the second day. Australia were bowled out for 408 on the morning of the third day. In reply, India opened the innings with Dhawan and Vijay. The duo batted out the rest of the third day taking India to 283 for no loss at stumps on the third day, with Dhawan batting on 185 and Vijay batting on 83. In the process, Dhawan scored the fastest century ever on Test debut, off 85 balls, breaking the long-held record of Gundappa Viswanath (137 vs Australia at Kanpur, 1969). Dhawan was dismissed for 187 (174 balls) in the second over of the fourth day, caught by Ed Cowan at silly point off the bowling of Nathan Lyon. He did not bat in India's second innings after suffering a hand injury while fielding during the fourth day. India went on to win the match by 6 wickets, and Dhawan won the man of the match award. The knock was later named as the Best Test Batting Performance of 2013 by ESPNcricinfo.
He missed the fourth Test at Delhi after being ruled out for six weeks due to a fracture in his left hand.
Dhawan made his comeback from injury during the 2013 Indian Premier League in a match for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Chennai Super Kings on 25 April and scored 63 runs from 45 balls. He played 10 matches that season and scored 311 runs at an average of 38.87 including three fifties. His good form helped him gain selection to the Indian ODI squad for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy that was to be held in England in June. Dhawan opened the batting with Rohit Sharma in the tournament and the pair found success. In the tournament's opening match between India and South Africa at Cardiff, Dhawan scored his maiden ODI hundred—114 from 94 balls including 12 fours and a six. He shared an opening partnership of 127 runs with Sharma. India won and he was named the man of the match. His knock was nominated to be one of the best ODI batting performances of the year 2013 by ESPNcricinfo. In India's next match against West Indies, he scored an unbeaten 102 off 107 balls, his second ODI hundred, adding 101 for the first wicket with Rohit. India chased down the target of 234 for the loss of two wickets and more than 10 overs to spare. India's last group fixture was a rain-curtailed match at Birmingham against Pakistan, which India won by 8 wickets (D/L method). Dhawan scored 48 off 41 balls in this match. India topped the group table by winning all matches and qualified for the semifinals. In the semifinal match against Sri Lanka, he scored a 92-ball 68 which helped India win by 8 wickets with 15 overs to spare. This win took India to the final at Birmingham where they would face the hosts England. The final was reduced to 20-overs-a-side after rain delayed the start of play. India batted first and made 129/7 with Dhawan scoring 31 runs off 24 balls. India went on to win the match by 5 runs. Dhawan, who scored 363 runs from 5 matches at an average of 90.75 and a strike rate of over 100, won the Golden Bat award for scoring the most runs in the tournament and was also named player of the tournament. He was also named as part of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC and ESPNcricinfo. Dhawan was 5 runs shy of the 7500 mark in T20s before IPL 2020 Match 30. 34-year-old Dhawan achieved the milestone in his 267th T20 and 264th innings.
Big Match Player[edit]
The Indian team then went to the West Indies for a triangular series against West Indies and Sri Lanka. Dhawan scored 135 runs in five games at an average of 27. His only half-century in the series came against West Indies at Port of Spain where he made 69 off 77 balls. India won the series by beating Sri Lanka in the final in which he scored 16. In July–August, India toured Zimbabwe for five ODIs, resting several first-choice players, under the captaincy of Virat Kohli. Dhawan scored a total of 209 runs in four matches at an average of 52.25 and finished as the leading run-getter of the series, while India won the series 5–0. In the second match at Harare, he scored his third ODI century. He was awarded the man of the match for his innings of 116 which helped India post 294/8 after being 65/4 in the 17th over.
"I haven't seen a better innings in one-day cricket than this one. The way he batted today, I thought he would get 300. They were clean hits, all proper cricketing shots. He pulled, he cut, he drove. He played all shots today and it was a real treat to watch."
–India A coach Lalchand Rajput on Dhawan's knock of 248
In August 2013, he played for India A on its tour of South Africa. He continued to be in good form in the triangular series against South Africa A and Australia A. He recorded the second-highest List A innings of all time by scoring 248 runs off 150 balls against South Africa A in the last group match of the series at Pretoria, the winner of which would play Australia A in the final. His innings included 30 fours and seven sixes and helped India A put up 433/3 on board and win the match by 39 runs. After the match, South Africa A captain Justin Ontong described Dhawan's knock as "the best one-day innings" he had ever seen, and added "Every shot he hit found the gap or went over the fielders. It was like watching a highlights package. He hit so many good shots, it's hard to pick out one that stood out. There were a few sixes that went into the construction site." Dhawan then scored 62 in the final against Australia A as India A clinched the series with a 50-run win. He finished as the highest run-getter of the series, scoring 410 runs at an average of 102.50 and a strike rate of over 135.
Australia toured India in October and November 2013 for one T20I and seven ODIs. Dhawan scored a personal best 32 in the T20I game which India won. In the ODIs, he scored 284 runs in 6 innings at an average of 56.80 and was involved in three century opening stands with Rohit Sharma. In the second ODI at Jaipur, Dhawan scored 95 off 86 balls to help India chase down the target of 360 for the loss of just one wicket, the second-highest successful run-chase in the history of ODI cricket. In the sixth game at Nagpur, he scored a 102-ball 100, his fourth ODI century, which helped India successfully chase Australia's total of 350. He was dismissed for 60 in the final match at Bangalore which India won to clinch the series. In November 2013, after being unable to convert starts into big knocks in the two-match Test series and the first two ODIs against West Indies, Dhawan scored a match-winning 119 off just 95 balls in the series-deciding third ODI at Kanpur and was named player of the match.
For his performances in 2013, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC. He was also named in the ODI XI by ESPNcricinfo for his performances in 2013.
