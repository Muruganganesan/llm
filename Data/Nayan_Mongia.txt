In the year 2000, Mohommad Azharuddin told CBI that he took money from bookies to fix a match, he also revealed that Ajay Jadeja and Nayan Mongia were involved in fixing. Ex- secretary of BCCI Jayawant Lele in his book alleged Mongia for fixing and playing intentionally slow, in his book 'I was there- Memories of a Cricket administrator'. As per Lele, Mongia was isolated in dressing room, he wrote 3 incidents which might had raised suspicions on Mongia by his fellow player like Tendulkar, Ganguly and caused his isolation. Per Lele 'In 1994's Kanpur ODI against West Indies, Mongia deliberately played slow and scored 16 runs in 9 overs, India lost that match'. He came under investigation after this match. Mongia denied Lele's allegations. His name was in the report of CBI with Mohommad Azharuddin. Later his charges got lifted and he returned in national team.
