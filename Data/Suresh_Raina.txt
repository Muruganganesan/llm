His knock of 100 against England during England tour of India 2012–13 at Cardiff was nominated to be one of the best ODI batting performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo.
Raina was not selected in India's first tour to USA, where they played against West Indies for 2 T20Is. However, he made a re-entry to the ODI team for a series against New Zealand. Later he was ruled out due to Chikungunya .
In 2011, India toured West Indies after the World Cup with captain MS Dhoni rested and vice-captain Virender Sehwag injured.

In the 2015 Cricket World Cup league stage match vs Pakistan, Raina "blasted his way to 74 off 56 balls… that set the momentum for India’s impressive total of 300 for seven.”
Raina returned to the Indian T20 international side in February 2018 on the back of his recent performance in domestic cricket particularly Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. He was named in the Indian T20I squad where India would face South Africa in three match T20I series. The series went well for him as he became the talk of the town as he smashed 43 runs off 27 balls to help India post a competitive total on board in the final T20I.

Franchise career

Playing style
Suresh Raina batting at Adelaide Oval
Raina is an attacking middle order left handed batter. His favourite scoring area is mid wicket on the leg side. He plays inside out off drive shot frequently. While trying to hit an inside out off side shot, he creates room for himself. He is particularly strong on the leg side, where he employs a wide array of shots, including the flick, pull, and slog sweep. He has weakness against short pitched balls and throughout his career, opposition teams tried to exploit this weakness. Also in Ranji trophy he has struggled against short balls. He has been widely criticised for his short ball weakness. He is a part time off break bowler.
In addition to his batting and part time bowling, Raina is an exceptional fielder, renowned for his agility, sharp reflexes and throwing accuracy. He is often stationed in the inner ring, saving runs and effecting crucial run-outs. Former South African Cricketer Jonty Rhodes has ranked Suresh Raina as Number 1 in his 'top fielders' list.
