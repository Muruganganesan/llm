2010–11: Debut and early years[edit]
On the back of his impressive performance in the 2010 Indian Premier League, Ashwin was selected for the Indian squad that toured Zimbabwe for a tri-series in May 2010. He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka on 5 June 2010, scoring a 32–ball 38 and taking 2/50 in that match, which India lost. His T20I debut came a week later, against Zimbabwe at Harare where he took 1/22 in four overs in an Indian win.
Ashwin was part of the squad for the 2010 Asia Cup, which India won. He was also part of the tri-series against New Zealand and Sri Lanka, but did not get a game, with Pragyan Ojha and Ravindra Jadeja being preferred.

Ashwin was part of the 15-member 2011 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Piyush Chawla being the other two specialist spinners in the squad. Ashwin played only two matches in World cup, which India won, defeating Sri Lanka in the finals.

Ashwin was retained in the limited-overs squad for the England tour and emerged as India's best bowler of the series, taking six wickets at an average of 25.16. When England toured India in October 2011, Ashwin was the second-highest wicket-taker of the series, with ten wickets in a 5–0 victory.

Ashwin in a T20 match against Australia in 2012
In November 2011, West Indies toured India for three Tests and five ODIs, with Ashwin and Ojha being the only two specialist spinners in the squad. Ashwin made his Test debut in the first match at Delhi, earning his cap from Sachin Tendulkar. He took 3/81 in the first innings and picked a fifer with 6/47 in the second, helping India win the match and was awarded the man of the match, becoming the third Indian player to win the award on Test debut. He picked four wickets in the second Test at Kolkata, where India registered an innings victory. In the third Test at Mumbai, he took 5/156 and scored his maiden international century in India's first innings, thus becoming only the third Indian to score a century and take a five-wicket haul in the same Test and the first since 1962. The match ended in a draw with the scores level, and was awarded the man of the match as well as the man of the series for his all-round performance.

2012–15: Middle years and consolidation[edit]
Ashwin returned to form during the two-match home Test series against New Zealand. In the first Test at Hyderabad, he claimed 6/31 and 6/54, helping India seal an innings victory and was named the man of the match with his match figures of 12/85, bettering S. Venkataraghavan's 12/152 for the best figures by an Indian bowler against New Zealand in Tests. In the second match at Bangalore, his efforts of 5/69 in the second innings helped India win the match and the series 2–0. He was awarded man of the series for his tally of 18 wickets at an average of 13.11. Ashwin played four matches in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka and took five wickets at an economy rate of 6 and an average of 19.
During the first Test of England's tour of India in late 2012, Ashwin became the fastest Indian to record 50 wickets in Test cricket as he overhauled the milestone in his ninth game. India eventually lost the series 2–1 in which Ashwin managed to take only 14 wickets in the four Tests at an average of 52.64. However, he scored 243 runs, averaging 60.75, including two fifties, and finished as India's second best batsman of the series. In the three-match ODI series against Pakistan and the five-match ODI series against England, he took three wickets at 43.33 and seven wickets at 35.71, respectively.
There were a few changes I had to make after the England series [...] I had to work on my delivery stride, it had got a little long during the England series and that was affecting the way I was delivering the ball. We had very little time, but I was lucky to have a coach [Subramaniam] who identified it pretty quickly.
— Ashwin on the changes he made to his bowling before the Australia series
In February 2013, Ashwin worked with Sunil Subramaniam to make changes to his bowling ahead of the four-match Test series against Australia, including shortening of his bowling stride. Ashwin had a successful series in the Australia's four-Test tour of India in February–March 2013. In the first Test at Chennai, his home ground, he took 7/103 and 5/95, leading India to a comfortable eight-wicket victory. He had a haul of 5/63 in the second innings of the second Test at Hyderabad, where India registered an innings win and took four wickets in the third Test at Mohali, where India sealed the series with a six-wicket victory. In the last match at Delhi, he took 5/57 and 2/55 in another Indian win which completed a 4–0 whitewash of Australia. During the match, Ashwin surpassed Anil Kumble's record of 27 wickets for the most wickets by an Indian bowler in a four-Test series. Ashwin finished the series as the leading wicket-taker with a tally of 29 wickets at 20.10 and won the Man of the Series award. It was the first time India won four or more Tests in a series and the first time Australia was whitewashed since 1969–70.
Ashwin was part of the Indian team that won the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy in England. His match figures of 2/15 in four overs in the 20-overs-a-side final helped India restrict England to 124/8 and win the match by five runs. He had a total of eight wickets from five matches at an average of 22.62, conceding 4.41 runs per over, and ended as the joint-fifth highest wicket-taker of the tournament and was named in the 'Team of the Tournament'. With nine wickets in six matches, Ashwin finished as the leading wicket-taker of the home ODI series against Australia in October–November 2013, which India won 3–2.
On India's tour of South Africa, Ashwin had a difficult time with the ball, picking up only one wicket across three ODIs and went wicketless in his 42 overs in the first Test at Johannesburg, following which, he was dropped for the second Test. In early 2014, Ashwin's overseas struggles continued during the New Zealand tour, where he managed to bag a solitary wicket in the five-match ODI series, which India lost 4–0. However, in the third ODI, coming in to bat with India at 146/5 in pursuit of 315, he scored his maiden ODI fifty of 65 runs from 46 balls. He shared a 38-run partnership with Dhoni and an 85-run seventh wicket stands with Jadeja, as the match eventually ended in a tie. In the two-match Test series that followed, Jadeja was preferred over Ashwin as the lone spinner in the playing eleven.
Ashwin was back among the wickets when India went to Bangladesh for the 2014 Asia Cup and the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. He took nine wickets in four matches of the Asia Cup and finished as the joint-third highest wicket-taker of the tournament. He played a vital role in India's unbeaten run to the World Twenty20 final. His tally of 11 wickets in six matches at an average of 11.27 and an economy rate of 5.35 put him joint third on the list of most wickets in the tournament. He was named in the "Team of the Tournament" for the 2014 T20 World Cup by the ICC and ESPNcricinfo.
Ashwin was part of the Indian team that toured England in 2014. He played only two matches in the five Test series, scoring 40 and 46 not out but going wicketless in the fourth Test and taking three wickets in the last match, both of which ended in defeats. India won the ODI series that followed 3–1. with Ashwin taking seven wickets from four matches at an average of 24.85 and an economy rate of less than 4.5. India whitewashed Sri Lanka in a five-match ODI series in November 2014, in which Ashwin took 6 wickets to his name at 33.33. Ashwin was not part of the first Test of India's tour of Australia in December 2014. He returned to the playing eleven in the second test and took a total of 12 wickets at an average of 48.66 in the remaining three matches.
2015–19: Consistency and rise to stardom[edit]
I see a lot of myself in Ashwin. He is a fantastic cricketer with a lot of work ethic. Obviously, he is a far better batsman than me.
— Former India Test captain Anil Kumble on Ashwin, February 2015
Ashwin was selected to represent India for the second consecutive ODI World cup held in Australia and New Zealand in 2015. He took 13 wickets in 8 matches in India's run to the semi-finals and was named on the bench in the 'Team of the tournament'. In the 2015 three-match series against Sri Lanka, he finished with 21 wickets and, in the process, broke the record for the most wickets by an Indian bowler in a series against Sri Lanka, winning the Man of the Series award. These efforts led him to achieve the top ranking in ICC men's rankings for bowlers in tests for the year 2015.
In November 2015, Ashwin was a star performer throughout the Freedom Trophy Test series against South Africa in India. During the course of the series, he became the fastest Indian to reach 150 wickets in Test cricket.

Ashwin was the lead wicket-taker with four wickets in the 2021 ICC World Test Championship final loss to New Zealand in June 2021.
In September 2021, Ashwin earned a surprise recall to the Indian squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, more than four years since he played a T20 international. He made the comeback in white-ball cricket in India's third match of the tournament against Afghanistan and bowled a good spell taking two wickets for 14 runs in four overs. Ashwin continued to play T20 international matches across 2021 and 2022. He was also named in the Indian squad, which reached the semi-finals of the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, playing all six matches and taking six wickets.
In the 2021–22 season, India won the home series against New Zealand and Sri Lanka where Ashwin ended up as the leading wicket taker in both series. His consistent performances in test cricket enabled him to be named in the ICC Test team of the year for 2021.

Ashwin was signed as a domestic player by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008. He made his debut for the Chennai Super Kings during the 2009 season and represented the team for eight consecutive seasons till 2015. His break through season came in 2010 when he took 13 wickets to help Chennai win their first IPL title and qualify for Champions League Twenty20. Chennai won the Champions league title in 2010 with Ashwin being named player of the series. Ashwin was the fourth highest wicket taker with 20 wickets in the 2011 Indian Premier League season, helping Chennai win a second consecutive title. Ashwin won his second Champions League Twenty20 title in 2014 with CSK. Ashwin took 90 wickets from 97 matches in the IPL across eight seasons for the Super Kings.
Following the two-year suspension of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, two new franchises Rising Pune Supergiants and Gujarat Lions were established for the 2016 Indian Premier League season. Supergiants picked Ashwin as one of their five draft picks on 15 December 2015 for ₹75 million (US$890,000). He took ten wickets in the 2016 season before being ruled out of 2017 season due to an injury. In the 2018 player auction, Ashwin was picked up by Punjab Kings for ₹75 million (US$890,000). He was appointed as captain of Punjab for the 2018 season. In March 2019, in a match against Rajasthan Royals, Ashwin ran out a batter "backing up" (Jos Buttler), reigniting a debate around the mode of dismissal. This ultimately led to a rule change by MCC that the Law on running out the non-striker would be moved into Law 38 (Run Out) rather than Law 41 (Unfair Play).
Ahead of the 2020 season, Ashwin was traded to Delhi Capitals. He took 13 wickets in the season and was the fourth highest-wicket taker in the team. Delhi retained him for the 2021 season. In the 2022 IPL Auction, Ashwin was bought by the Rajasthan Royals for ₹50 million (US$590,000). During the group stage match against Lucknow Super Giants in the 2022 season, he tactically retired out in the 19th over, becoming the first cricketer in IPL to do so. He took 12 wickets and scored 191 runs to take Rajasthan to the finals of the 2022 season. In April 2022, Ashwin became only the second off-spinner after Harbhajan Singh to take 150 wickets in IPL and is the joint-fifth highest-wicket taker in the league alongside Sunil Narine with 180 wickets. In the 2025 player auction, Ashwin was picked up by the Chennai Super Kings for ₹97.5 million (US$1.2 million). After one season with the Super Kings, he announced his retirement from IPL on 27 August 2025.
Bowling style[edit]
Ashwin is widely regarded as one of the most prolific off spinners of all time. He produces several variations of the ball and flights the ball, thereby giving it more chance to spin and dip on the batsman. In addition to his normal off-breaks, he produces an arm ball and the carrom ball, the latter of which he uses frequently in the shorter formats. In IPL 2013, he bowled leg-breaks and googly as well. He evolved his carrom ball from the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak used in tennis ball cricket on the streets of Chennai. However, he has stated in an interview that he refrains from bowling the doosra as it requires him to bend and straighten his arm which he finds difficult to do.
Ashwin's childhood coach Sunil Subramaniam recalls Ashwin's early days at the TNCA Academy:
[...] what struck me was his intelligence. His use of angles, length and width of the crease. Also, guessing what a batsman was likely to do. And the kind of field placing that he is comfortable with. Those are the factors that struck me immediately – that this guy not only loves bowling, he also has a fair idea of what spin actually is. For somebody who started out at 18 or 19, I thought that was a big thing [...] Here is a guy who knew what the ball is supposed to do, where this guy is expected to play and what are the plans to keep that guy in check and put pressure on that guy.
